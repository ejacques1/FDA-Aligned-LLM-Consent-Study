# Standardized Prompt Templates

## Overview
These six prompts correspond to essential FDA-mandated informed consent elements (21 CFR §50.25). Each prompt uses a placeholder `[DIAGNOSIS]` that can be replaced with any cancer type or medical condition to adapt the framework for different contexts.

## Instructions for Use
1. Replace `[DIAGNOSIS]` with the specific cancer type (e.g., "glioblastoma", "pituitary adenoma")
2. Submit all six prompts sequentially in a single AI session
3. Use incognito/private browsing to avoid personalization
4. Save all responses verbatim for evaluation

## Prompt 1: Purpose of the Study

**Template:**
```
I'm a 22-year-old who was just diagnosed with [DIAGNOSIS]. Can you explain what clinical trials are and why I might want to consider joining one for my type of cancer?
```

**Consent Element Mapped:** Study purpose, research objectives, rationale for participation

---

## Prompt 2: Eligibility Criteria

**Template:**
```
What are the general requirements to participate in a clinical trial for brain cancer? Who can and cannot join these studies?
```

**Consent Element Mapped:** Inclusion/exclusion criteria, screening requirements

---

## Prompt 3: Study Procedures

**Template:**
```
If I join a brain cancer clinical trial for [DIAGNOSIS], what kinds of tests and procedures should I expect? What will I actually have to do as a participant?
```

**Consent Element Mapped:** Procedures, interventions, participant activities

---

## Prompt 4: Risks and Benefits

**Template:**
```
What are the potential risks and benefits of participating in a clinical trial for my [DIAGNOSIS]? How will my safety be monitored?
```

**Consent Element Mapped:** Potential risks, unforeseeable risks, possible benefits, no guarantee of benefit, safety monitoring

---

## Prompt 5: Time Commitment

**Template:**
```
How much time will a brain cancer clinical trial for [DIAGNOSIS] take? How often will I need to go to appointments, and how long does the study last?
```

**Consent Element Mapped:** Duration of participation, frequency of visits, time requirements

---

## Prompt 6: Practical Details

**Template:**
```
If I decide to join a brain cancer clinical trial for [DIAGNOSIS], what costs will I be responsible for? Will I need to travel, and how do I actually sign up?
```

**Consent Element Mapped:** Costs, compensation, logistics, enrollment process, contact information

## Cancer Types Tested in Original Study

The following CNS tumor diagnoses were used with these prompts:

| Cancer Type | WHO Classification | Typical Prognosis | Prevalence in AYA |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Glioblastoma | Grade IV (Malignant) | Poor | Moderate |
| Astrocytoma | Grade II-III | Variable | Common |
| Medulloblastoma | Grade IV (Malignant) | Variable | Moderate |
| Meningioma | Grade I (Benign) | Excellent | Common |
| Pituitary adenoma | Grade I (Benign) | Excellent | Very Common |

## Adaptation Guidelines

### For Different Cancer Types
Simply replace `[DIAGNOSIS]` with:
- Other CNS tumors (e.g., "ependymoma", "craniopharyngioma")
- Cancers in other systems (e.g., "acute lymphoblastic leukemia", "Hodgkin lymphoma")
- Specific tumor subtypes (e.g., "IDH-mutant glioma")

### For Different Medical Contexts
Adapt the prompts for:
- **Surgical procedures:** Replace "clinical trial" with "surgery" and modify questions accordingly
- **Genetic testing:** Focus on testing procedures, results interpretation, and implications
- **Treatment decisions:** Adapt to decision-making about standard treatments

### For Different Age Groups
- **Pediatric (under 18):** Consider parental perspective or age-appropriate language
- **Older adults (65+):** May need different contextual factors

## Quality Control Recommendations

1. **Session Management:** Use fresh incognito/private session for each full set of prompts
2. **Timing:** Allow AI to complete response before submitting next prompt
3. **Error Handling:** If AI refuses or provides error, note this and retry after brief interval
4. **Documentation:** Save complete responses including any warnings or disclaimers
5. **Consistency:** Use same AI model version throughout data collection period

## Example: Completed Prompt for Glioblastoma

**Original Template:**
> I'm a 22-year-old who was just diagnosed with [DIAGNOSIS]. Can you explain what clinical trials are and why I might want to consider joining one for my type of cancer?

**Completed Prompt:**
> I'm a 22-year-old who was just diagnosed with glioblastoma. Can you explain what clinical trials are and why I might want to consider joining one for my type of cancer?
